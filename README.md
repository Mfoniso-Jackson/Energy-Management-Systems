Energy Management Systems (EMS) are software applications that monitor and control the consumption of energy in a building, facility or organization. The purpose of an EMS is to reduce energy costs and improve energy efficiency by automating energy consumption data collection, analysis and reporting, and by implementing control strategies such as load shedding, demand response, and real-time monitoring. An EMS can also integrate with other building systems such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting and renewable energy sources to provide a comprehensive view of energy usage and to support informed decision-making.


## FAQ

#### What does an Energy Management System do?
