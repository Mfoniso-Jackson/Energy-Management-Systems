    "This code demonstrates a simple example of a real-time energy monitoring system that continuously reads energy data from a sensor or API and uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions about energy consumption. The code loads a pre-trained model using the joblib library, then it defines a function that reads energy data and calls it within a while loop, the loop will run indefinitely, so the system can read and make predictions in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this is a very basic example and a real-world energy monitoring software would likely be more complex and have additional functionality, such as data visualization, alarms, notifications, integration with other building systems, and handling missing data and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this example only shows the energy prediction step, in a real-world scenario you would need to gather data from different sources, clean and preprocess it, train the model, validate it, and deploy it to monitor energy usage in real-time."
