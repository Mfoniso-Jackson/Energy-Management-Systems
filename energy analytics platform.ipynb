    "This code demonstrates a simple example of an energy analytics platform that loads energy usage data from a CSV file, creates a line chart of energy usage over time, and a bar chart of energy usage by hour of the day. It uses the pandas library to load and manipulate the data and the matplotlib library to create the charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this is a very basic example and a real-world energy analytics platform would likely be more complex and have additional functionality, such as data visualization, data cleaning, data preprocessing, handling missing data and errors, and integration with other building systems, and machine learning models to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this example only shows the data visualization step, in a real-world scenario you would need to gather data from different sources, clean and preprocess it, validate it, and deploy it to make the platform usable for building managers."
