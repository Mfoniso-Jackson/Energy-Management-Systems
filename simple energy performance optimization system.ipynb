    "This code demonstrates a simple example of an energy performance optimization system that uses a random forest regression machine learning model to analyze energy consumption data and identify ways to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs. It uses the pandas library to load and preprocess the data, the numpy library for mathematical calculations, and the scikit-learn library to train and evaluate the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses the trained model to identify the most important factors that contribute to energy consumption and make recommendations for reducing energy consumption based on these factors. It's important to note that this is just a simple example and a real-world energy performance optimization system would likely be more complex and have additional functionality, such as data cleaning, data preprocessing, handling missing data and errors, and integration with other building systems and real-time data sources. Additionally, the choice of machine learning algorithm will depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the energy consumption data and the desired level of accuracy for the energy consumption predictions."
