    "This code demonstrates a simple example of an occupancy detection system that uses a random forest machine learning model to detect and track the presence of people in a building based on environmental sensor data, such as temperature, light, and humidity. It uses the pandas library to load and preprocess the data, the numpy library for mathematical calculations, and the scikit-learn library to train and evaluate the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this is just a simple example and a real-world occupancy detection system would likely be more complex and have additional functionality, such as data cleaning, data preprocessing, handling missing data and errors, and integration with other building systems. Additionally, the choice of machine learning algorithm will depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the sensor data and the desired level of accuracy for the occupancy predictions."
