    "This code demonstrates a simple example of a smart grid management system that uses a linear regression machine learning model to manage the distribution of electricity from power plants to consumers, balancing supply and demand based on historical data of electricity demand and related environmental factors such as temperature and time of day. It uses the pandas library to load and preprocess the data, the numpy library for mathematical calculations, and the scikit-learn library to train and evaluate the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this is just a simple example and a real-world smart grid management system would likely be more complex and have additional functionality, such as data cleaning, data preprocessing, handling missing data and errors, and integration with other grid systems and real-time data sources. Additionally, the choice of machine learning algorithm will depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the demand data and the desired level of accuracy for the demand predictions."
